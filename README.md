A personal project to improve my family's convenience at home.

Indoor Microbit is capable of opening and closing two garage doors by sending a radio signal to the outdoor microbit. It also displays the current states of each door through the microbit's LEDs.

Outdoor Microbit is wired to three magnetic reed switches to activate each garage door.

Utilises a heartbeat system to minimise radio noise and ensure a constant connection is maintained and can be monitored between the microbits.
